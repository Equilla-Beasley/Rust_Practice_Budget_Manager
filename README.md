# Rust_Practice_Budget_Manager (ReadMe WIP)
**Goal:** Create a Budget Manager in Rust as a first attempt at learning this language.

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my first project in Rust! I have never programmed in this language before, but I'm looking to understand low-level programming languages better, and this language seemed like a great fit for me. I already have experience in programming, but I want to become familiar with the documentaiton for Rust, so I'm making this simple project. 

I chose a Budget Manager because I want to practice both creating visual elements and working with logic. I will have to store data as it comes in and out of the budget manager and then create a link between said data and the visual elements. This will not only give me more experience with Rust's library but also help me practice these skills which I can then use in future projects.

## Design
For the layout of this project, I want the focus on this application to be a pie chart. The pie chart represents the overall, given budget, and as more expenses are added, the pie chart changes to reflect the amount of money left. In combination with this, I will create an accompaning graph that will display the transaction history for the given budget.

To effectively create these two elements, I imagine that I will have to use a tree to keep track of the different transactions an then build my visual displays off the information in said tree.

**Note:** This idea is not my own, and it is inspired from a project description I saw on a website for [Top 15 Rust Projects to Elevate Your Skills](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/rust-practice-projects/#Beginner-Rust-Projects). However, the idea to display the Budget Manager as a graph and pie chart combo is my own.
